# Movie Recommender System Using Machine Learning

#### Overview
Develop a movie recommendation system that combines user personalization with key movie features like genre, keywords, and more. This project implements a movie recommendation system that combines cosine similarity for content-based filtering.

#### Cosine Similarity-Based Recommendation System:
This system compares movies based on their metadata (e.g., genres, descriptions). Uses the TfidfVectorizer to convert movie descriptions into numerical vectors. Calculates cosine similarity to find movies that are most similar to a given input movie.
